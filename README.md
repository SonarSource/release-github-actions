# release-github-actions

A centralized collection of reusable GitHub Actions designed to streamline and automate every stage of the analyzer release process.
This repository serves as a versatile toolbox, offering modular automations to eliminate manual, repetitive steps and reduce friction across
squads managing analyzer projects. Whether standardizing changelog generation, automating version bumps, handling release publishing,
or coordinating cross-repository tasks, these actions help teams back away from cumbersome workflows and focus more on code quality.
Pick and combine the automations best suited for your analyzerâ€™s unique release requirements, and easily extend the toolbox to cover new
scenarios as they arise.

## Development

### Update Action Versions Workflow

The repository includes an `update-action-versions` workflow that creates a pull request to update all internal action references to use a
specific commit or the latest version from the master branch.
This workflow scans all `action.yml` files in the repository and updates any references to `SonarSource/release-github-actions` actions to
point to the specified reference, ensuring consistency across all actions when updates are made to shared components.
