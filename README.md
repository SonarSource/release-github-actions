# release-github-actions

A centralized collection of reusable GitHub Actions designed to streamline and automate every stage of the analyzer release process. This repository serves as a versatile toolbox, offering modular automations to eliminate manual, repetitive steps and reduce friction across squads managing analyzer projects. Whether standardizing changelog generation, automating version bumps, handling release publishing, or coordinating cross-repository tasks, these actions help teams back away from cumbersome workflows and focus more on code quality. Pick and combine the automations best suited for your analyzerâ€™s unique release requirements, and easily extend the toolbox to cover new scenarios as they arise.
